  widgets_values: ['', '<think>\nOkay, let\'s tackle this. The user wants 10 image generation prompts based on a gothic-inspired engineer in power armor during a space battle. Each prompt needs to follow specific rules: use Danbooru tags, include detailed descriptions, alternate male and female engineers, and avoid blood/gore. \n\nFirst, I need to ensure each prompt starts with the required tags. The structure from the rules suggests starting with quality tags like (masterwork, masterpiece, etc.), then character count (1girl or 1boy), followed by descriptors. The setting is a gothic spacecraft hull with a space battle outside. \n\nFor each prompt, I\'ll alternate between male and female engineers. The armor should be bulky with religious symbols—maybe crosses, stained glass motifs, or cathedral-like designs. The spacecraft interior should have gothic elements like arches, brass pipes, and steam. The background needs to show the battle between gothic and traditional sci-fi ships, so terms like plasma cannons, laser fire, and nebula could work.\n\nI must include terms like "gothic-inspired power armour," "bulky armour," "religious symbolism," "gothic spacecraft hull," and "space battle" in each prompt. Also, avoid any blood or gore. \n\nLet me check the example given in the rules to ensure I\'m formatting correctly. The example uses tags first, then descriptors. I\'ll follow that. For each engineer, describe their appearance in detail since the AI might not know the names. Maybe use names like Sister Valeria or Brother Gideon to add a religious touch. \n\nNeed to vary the poses: some standing defiantly, others repairing consoles, maybe one kneeling. The background should consistently show the battle through windows or damaged hull parts. Style elements like steampunk gears, neon lights, or stained glass effects can add atmosphere. \n\nMake sure each prompt ends with style tags like atmospheric, dark gothic-scifi, and maybe steampunk. Also, include the required terms in each. Let me draft a few to test the structure, then ensure all 10 meet the criteria without repetition.\n</think>']

Also, I find that it\'s just easier to work with and to get better images quickly.\nOptimal Settings\n\nBased on both testing and official documentation:\n\n● CFG Range: 4.5-7.5 (sweet spot around 5.5)\n\n● Recommended Sampler: Euler A\n\n● Steps: 20+ (24 recommended)\nWorking Prompt Structure\n\nAs I mentioned above, you definitely need to massage the prompt a bit more than most other models, at least at this point in time (Illustrious XL v0.1). As a result, you need to have quality tags in your positive prompt and a pretty extensive negative prompt to get it to work well.\nPrompt Structure\nCore Structure\n\n1. Character count (1girl, 2girls, etc.)\n\n2. Character names (if any)\n\n3. Quality tags\n\n4. Physical features & clothing\n\n5. Pose & anatomical details\n\n6. Environment/background\n\n7. Additional quality/style tags\nPositive prompt tags (put at end or beginning)\n\nFrom the paper, their actual example quality tags are much simpler:\n\n● "masterpiece"\n\n● "general" (as a rating tag for safe for work images)\n\n● "absurdres"\n\n● "year 2023"\n\nTechnically these are all you need to produce a good image, according to the Illustrious paper. I\'ve also corroborated this in my own testing.\n\nHowever, I\'ve found that these prompt tags can produce fairly consistent results when used in combination with those tags above:\n\nperfect quality, best quality, absolutely eye-catching,\n\nand with more realistic/detailed imagery:\n\nperfect quality, best quality, absolutely eye-catching, ambient occlusion, raytracing,\n\nambient occlusion/raytracing help with 2.5d/semi-real style especially\nNegative prompt\n\nAfter a lot of experimentation, I found this works the best, on average, pretty much every time:\n\nlowres, (bad), bad anatomy, bad hands, extra digits, multiple views,fewer, extra, missing, text, error, worst quality, jpeg artifacts, low quality, watermark, unfinished, displeasing, oldest, early,chromatic aberration, signature,artistic error, username, scan\n\nor as a shorter alternative:\n\nlowres, worst quality, bad quality, bad anatomy, sketch, jpeg artifacts, signature, watermark, artist name, old, oldest\n\n1girl, ashley_grah4m, anatomically correct, proper proportions,\n\nneon lighting, glowing blonde hair, rainbow inner hair, blue eyes,well-defined pose, standing pose, balanced pose,detailed environment, professional lighting, clear composition,looking at viewer, seductive expression,masterpiece, best quality, absurdres\nCreating Effective Backgrounds\n\nStructure for Background Prompts:\n\nEnvironment Base:\n\ndetailed environment, [location type], clear composition\n\nArchitectural Elements:\n\n[material types], [structural elements], [decorative elements]\n\nLighting and Atmosphere:\n\n[time of day], [lighting type], [atmosphere effects]\nExample Background Combinations:\n\nIndoor Scenes:\n\nluxurious room, detailed architecture, marble floor, ornate furniture,\n\ncrystal chandeliers, tall windows, decorative columns,\n\nwarm ambient lighting, soft shadows, volumetric lighting\n\nOutdoor Urban:\n\ndetailed cityscape, modern architecture, glass buildings,\n\ncity streets, urban details, store fronts,\n\nnight scene, neon lighting, street lamps, ambient occlusion\n\nNatural Settings:\n\ndetailed landscape, rolling hills, dense forest,\n\nrocky outcrops, flowing water, detailed foliage,\n\ngolden hour lighting, atmospheric haze, dynamic clouds\nBackground Best Practices:\n\n1. Start with broad environment definition\n\n2. Add specific architectural or natural elements\n\n3. Include material descriptions\n\n4. Define lighting and atmosphere\n\n5. Maintain consistency with character lighting\n\n6. Use environmental quality tags\nTips for Better Backgrounds:\n\n● Add depth indicators (foreground, midground, background)\n\n● Include atmospheric effects\n\n● Specify clear lighting sources\n\n● Use architectural details for indoor scenes\n\n● Add environmental context\n\n● Keep perspective consistent with character pose\nCommon Background Issues:\n\n● Inconsistent lighting between character and background\n\n● Perspective mismatches\n\n● Lack of detail in middle ground\n\n● Poor integration with character\n\n● Missing environmental context\nSolutions:\n\n1. Use consistent lighting descriptors\n\n2. Add specific perspective tags\n\n3. Include depth and distance markers\n\n4. Specify material and texture details\n\n5. Use architectural or natural anchoring elements\nKnown Issues\n\n● Multiple competing style tags tend to produce inconsistent results\n\n● Needs specific prompting to work well\nBest Practices\n\n● Use those prompts from above!\n\n● Start with minimal parameters\n\n● Pay particular attention to lighting descriptors\n\n● Monitor CFG impact on output quality\nAdditional help re: Angles/Lighting\nangles, use/mix these after quality tags at beginning of prompt:\n\nfrom above,\n\nfrom below,\n\nclose-up,\n\nportrait,\n\nPOV,\n\nbirds-eye,\n\nwide shot,\n\nisometric,\n\n(+ view, depending)\nlighting, after angle tags, beginning or very end of prompt:\n\nCinematic Light,\n\nHollywood Lighting,\n\nBacklighting,\n\nRim lighting,\n\nSoft lighting,\n\nharsh lighting,\n\nDramatic light,\n\nfilm-style contrast,\n\nsoft shadows,\n\nharsh shadows,\n\n(you may have to fiddle with the position and wording of those, but they should mostly work as is)\nConclusion\n']
